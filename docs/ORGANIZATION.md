# Documentation Organization Complete âœ…

## Summary of Changes

Successfully reorganized all Doser documentation into a clear, logical structure.

### Before

```
doser/
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHITECTURE.md (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ RUNBOOK.md (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ security-performance-review.md (mixed with concepts)
    â”œâ”€â”€ DeveloperHandbook.md (mixed with concepts)
    â”œâ”€â”€ RUST_PRIMER.md (mixed)
    â””â”€â”€ [many files in flat structure]
```

### After

```

## Benefits

### 1. **Clear Information Architecture**

- Documents grouped by purpose (guides, reference, operations, etc.)
- Easy to find relevant documentation
- Scales well as project grows

### 2. **Role-Based Navigation**

- Users â†’ guides/ and reference/
- Developers â†’ guides/, concepts/, architecture/
- Operators â†’ ops/ and reference/
- Architects â†’ architecture/ and adr/

### 3. **Improved Discoverability**

- INDEX.md provides comprehensive navigation
- README.md offers quick links
- Clear folder names indicate content

### 4. **Better Maintenance**

- Related docs grouped together
- Easier to keep docs synchronized
- Clear ownership of doc types

## New Entry Points

### Primary: `docs/INDEX.md`

Complete documentation hub with:

- Full structure visualization
- Quick navigation by task
- Navigation by role
- Document type explanations
- Contribution guidelines

### Secondary: `docs/README.md`

Quick overview with:

- Folder structure
- Role-based quick links
- Pointer to INDEX.md

## Navigation Patterns

### By Task (I want to...)

INDEX.md provides "I want to..." â†’ relevant docs

### By Role (I am a...)

- User â†’ Config, Operations
- Developer â†’ Guides, Concepts, Architecture
- Operator â†’ Ops, Reference
- Architect â†’ Architecture, ADRs

### By Document Type

- **Guides**: Tutorial/learning
- **Reference**: Lookup info
- **Concepts**: Implementation details
- **Architecture**: Design docs
- **ADRs**: Decision records
- **Reviews**: Audits/analysis

## Files Moved

### To guides/

- DeveloperHandbook.md
- RUST_PRIMER.md
- RUST_PRIMER_DETAILED.md
- Glossary.md

### To architecture/

- ARCHITECTURE.md (from root)

### To ops/

- Runbook.md (from root, was RUNBOOK.md)

### To reference/

- CONFIG_SCHEMA.md
- OPERATIONS.md
- PI_SMOKE.md

### To reviews/

- security-performance-review.md
- business-best-practices-review.md
- fix-1.2-sampler-thread-lifecycle.md
- performance-roadmap.md

## Existing Structure Preserved

- concepts/ (already well-organized)
- architecture/ (enhanced with ARCHITECTURE.md)
- adr/ (already following best practices)
- testing/ (already organized)

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- âœ… Structure complete
- âœ… INDEX.md created
- âœ… README.md created
- âœ… Files moved

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide to reference/
- [ ] Generate API docs from rustdoc
- [ ] Add deployment checklist to ops/
- [ ] Add performance tuning guide to guides/
- [ ] Create migration guides for major versions

## Documentation Coverage

### Complete âœ…

- Getting started
- Architecture overview
- Development guide
- Operations guide
- Configuration reference
- Security review
- Business review

### Good ðŸŸ¢

- Rust concepts
- Implementation details
- Testing strategy
- ADRs

### Needs Improvement ðŸŸ¡

- API documentation (needs rustdoc generation)
- Troubleshooting guide (needs creation)
- Performance tuning (scattered in various docs)
- Migration guides (none yet)
