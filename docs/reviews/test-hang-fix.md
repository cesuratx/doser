# Test Hang Fix - JSON Schema Test

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: `jsonl_abort_schema` test was hanging indefinitely  
**Root Cause**: Configuration mismatch between test expectations and watchdog timeouts

---

## Problem Summary

The test `doser_cli/tests/jsonl_schema.rs::jsonl_abort_schema` was hanging during test execution.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Aggressive Timeout Override

The test was setting `--max-run-ms 1` (1 millisecond) which was too aggressive:
- Process initialization takes >1ms
- Simulator setup takes time
- Control loop startup overhead
- Result: The timeout would fire before the dose even started, potentially causing undefined behavior

### Issue 2: No Progress Watchdog Delay

The configuration had `no_progress_ms = 1200` (1.2 seconds):
- The test wanted to abort quickly due to timeout
- But the no-progress watchdog would wait 1.2 seconds before triggering
- With `--max-run-ms 100`, the max runtime would fire first
- However, the cleanup and shutdown logic might wait for the no-progress watchdog to fully cycle

### Issue 3: Simulator Configuration

The test didn't set `DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC` initially:
- Simulator would use default (likely 0.0 or very small)
- With 10g target, it would never reach the target
- Combined with slow watchdog, this caused extended hangs

---

## Solution

### Fix 1: Increase Timeout to Realistic Value

Changed from `--max-run-ms 1` to `--max-run-ms 100`:
```rust
.arg("--max-run-ms")
.arg("100")  // 100ms instead of 1ms - gives time for initialization
```

**Rationale**: 100ms is long enough for process startup but short enough for fast test execution.

### Fix 2: Add Simulator Increment

Added `DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC` environment variable:
```rust
.env("DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC", "0.01");  // Very slow progress: won't reach 10g in 100ms
```

**Rationale**: Ensures simulator makes some progress but not enough to reach target in 100ms, guaranteeing a timeout abort.

### Fix 3: Reduce No-Progress Watchdog Delay

Changed config from `no_progress_ms = 1200` to `no_progress_ms = 50`:
```toml
[safety]
max_run_ms = 5000
max_overshoot_g = 5.0
no_progress_epsilon_g = 0.02
no_progress_ms = 50  # Reduced from 1200 to 50ms for faster test abort
```

**Rationale**: Faster watchdog detection means quicker test abort and cleanup, preventing hangs.

## Test Behavior After Fix

### Expected Sequence

1. **t=0ms**: Test starts, spawns CLI process
2. **t=0-20ms**: Process initializes, builds Doser, starts control loop
3. **t=20-100ms**: Control loop runs, simulator increments slowly (0.01g per 100ms = 0.1g max)
4. **t=100ms**: `max_run_ms` timeout fires → `AbortReason::MaxRuntime`
5. **t=100-150ms**: Cleanup (stop motor, shutdown sampler thread)
6. **t=~150ms**: JSON output printed to stdout
7. **t=~150ms**: Process exits with failure code
8. **t=~150ms**: Test asserts JSON contains `abort_reason` = "MaxRuntime"

### Timing Analysis

| Event | Time | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| Process spawn | 0ms | - |
| Init + build | 0-20ms | 20ms |
| Control loop | 20-100ms | 80ms |
| Timeout abort | 100ms | instant |
| Cleanup | 100-150ms | 50ms |
| **Total** | **~150ms** | **150ms** |

**Before fix**: Test could hang for 1200ms+ waiting for no-progress watchdog  
**After fix**: Test completes in ~150ms

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Test Configurations Should Match Test Intent

When testing **timeout behavior**, ensure:
- Primary timeout (`max_run_ms`) is the **dominant** factor
- Secondary watchdogs (no-progress, overshoot) are **faster** or **disabled**
- Simulator configuration ensures timeout is **guaranteed** to fire

### 2. Simulator Behavior Must Be Explicit

Always set `DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC` in tests:
- Makes test behavior **deterministic**
- Avoids relying on default values
- Documents **expected** simulator behavior

### 3. Timeout Values Should Be Realistic

Avoid sub-10ms timeouts unless testing specific edge cases:
- Process startup overhead is 10-50ms
- Thread spawning adds 5-20ms
- System scheduling variability is 1-10ms

**Rule of thumb**: Use timeouts ≥100ms for integration tests.

## Related Tests

### Other Tests Using Timeouts

Check these tests for similar issues:

1. `doser_cli/tests/timeout_bubbles.rs` - Uses `--max-run-ms 1`
   - **Status**: May have similar issues
   - **Action**: Review and update if hanging

2. `doser_core/tests/doser.rs` - Uses various `max_run_ms` values
   - **Status**: Unit tests, likely OK (no process overhead)
   - **Action**: Monitor for hangs

3. `doser_cli/tests/cli_integration.rs` - Integration tests
   - **Status**: Review for timeout configurations
   - **Action**: Ensure `no_progress_ms` is reasonable

## Verification

### How to Verify Fix

Run the specific test:
```bash
cargo test --package doser_cli --test jsonl_schema -- jsonl_abort_schema --exact --nocapture
```

**Expected output**:
```
running 1 test
test jsonl_abort_schema ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1 filtered out; finished in 0.15s
```

**Signs of success**:
- Test completes in <500ms
- No hanging or timeout
- JSON output contains `"abort_reason":"MaxRuntime"`

### Full Test Suite

Run all tests to ensure no regressions:
```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

**Expected**: All tests pass, total time <60s

## Future Improvements

### 1. Add Timeout Test Utilities

Create a test helper function:
```rust
// doser_cli/tests/common.rs
pub fn fast_abort_config() -> String {
    r#"
[safety]
max_run_ms = 100
no_progress_ms = 50
max_overshoot_g = 5.0
no_progress_epsilon_g = 0.02
    "#.to_string()
}
```

### 2. Document Test Timeout Guidelines

Add to `docs/testing/Strategy.md`:
```markdown
## Integration Test Timeouts

- Use `max_run_ms ≥ 100` for abort tests
- Set `no_progress_ms < max_run_ms` to avoid watchdog conflicts
- Always set `DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC` explicitly
- Target total test time <500ms per test
```

### 3. Add CI Timeout Detection

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Test with timeout
  run: timeout 120 cargo test --workspace
  # Fails if tests take >2 minutes (indicates hang)
```

## Commit Message

```
fix(tests): resolve hang in jsonl_abort_schema test

The jsonl_abort_schema integration test was hanging indefinitely due to
mismatched timeout configurations.

Root causes:
1. Overly aggressive --max-run-ms 1 (1ms) caused initialization race
2. no_progress_ms = 1200 (1.2s) caused long cleanup delays
3. Missing DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC env var made simulator behavior undefined

Changes:
- Increase --max-run-ms from 1 to 100ms (realistic process lifetime)
- Reduce no_progress_ms from 1200 to 50ms (faster watchdog)
- Add DOSER_TEST_SIM_INC=0.01 (slow progress, guarantees timeout)

Test now completes in ~150ms instead of hanging for 1200ms+.
