### 1.2 Coffee Bean Characteristics (Why This Matters)

Coffee beans are **challenging** to dose accurately because:

1. **Variable Density**:
   - Light roast: 0.65-0.75 g/mL (denser, flows slower)
   - Dark roast: 0.55-0.65 g/mL (less dense, flows faster)
   - Your system: ✅ **Handles this via configurable control bands**

2. **Static Electricity**:
   - Beans stick to hopper/chute → unpredictable flow
   - Mitigation: Grind with RDT (Ross Droplet Technique) or anti-static spray
   - Your system: ⚠️ **May need longer settling time (`stable_ms`) for static-prone beans**

3. **Particle Size Distribution**:
   - Whole beans: Large, discrete chunks → jerky flow
   - Ground coffee: Fine powder → smooth, fast flow
   - Your system: ✅ **Speed bands + predictive stop handle both**

4. **Oil Content**:
   - Fresh beans: Oily, clumpy
   - Aged beans: Dry, free-flowing
   - Your system: ✅ **Median filter removes outliers from clumping**

**Recommendation**: Add **bean profile presets** to your config:

```toml
# doser_config.toml
[bean_profiles]
# For whole beans (slower, chunkier)
[bean_profiles.whole_light_roast]
filter.median_window = 7        # Smooth out chunky flow
control.hysteresis_g = 0.15     # Wider band for settling
control.stable_ms = 500         # Longer settle for static
predictor.epsilon_g = 0.3       # Aggressive early stop

# For ground coffee (faster, smoother)
[bean_profiles.ground_medium_roast]
filter.median_window = 5
control.hysteresis_g = 0.08
control.stable_ms = 300
predictor.epsilon_g = 0.2
```

## 2. Performance Analysis for Coffee Dosing

### 2.1 Accuracy (Most Critical for Espresso)

**Target**: 18.0g ± 0.1g for espresso (0.56% tolerance)

**Your System Performance** (from architecture docs):

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Raw accuracy** | ±0.1-0.2g typical | ±0.1g | ✅ Meets target |
| **Repeatability (CV)** | <1% with calibration | <2% | ✅ Exceeds target |
| **Overshoot** | 0.1-0.5g (tunable) | <0.3g | ✅ Configurable |
| **Settling time** | 300-500ms (configurable) | <1s | ✅ Fast enough |

**What Makes Your System Accurate**:

1. **Fixed-point arithmetic** (centigrams):
   - No floating-point rounding errors
   - Deterministic across platforms
   - **Business impact**: Consistent dose quality across all units

2. **Predictive stopping** (`predictor.epsilon_g`):
   - Anticipates momentum and stops early
   - Reduces overshoot from 0.5g → 0.1g
   - **Business impact**: Less bean waste (saves $0.02-0.05 per dose at $20/lb)

3. **Multi-stage filtering**:
   - Median filter removes sensor noise spikes
   - Moving average smooths jitter
   - EMA provides trend prediction
   - **Business impact**: Stable control even with cheap HX711 load cells

4. **Speed bands** (coarse → medium → fine):
   - Fast initial dispensing (80-100% speed)
   - Slow approach near target (20-40% speed)
   - **Business impact**: 8-12s total dose time (competitive with $2000+ commercial grinders)

**Accuracy Validation Test**:

```bash
# Run 30 consecutive doses, measure statistics
for i in {1..30}; do
  cargo run --features hardware -p doser_cli -- \
    --config ./coffee_bean_config.toml dose --grams 18.0 --json \
    | jq -r '.final_g'
done | awk '{sum+=$1; sumsq+=$1*$1} END {
  mean=sum/NR
  stdev=sqrt(sumsq/NR - mean^2)
  cv=stdev/mean*100
  printf "Mean: %.3fg, StdDev: %.3fg, CV: %.2f%%\n", mean, stdev, cv
}'
```

**Expected Result**: Mean ~18.05g, StdDev ~0.08g, CV ~0.44%

### 2.2 Speed (Important for Cafe Throughput)

**Target**: <15s per dose for commercial viability

**Your System Performance**:

| Phase | Time | % of Total |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Tare/Zero** | 200-500ms | 3-5% |
| **Coarse dispense** (to 80% target) | 3-5s | 40-50% |
| **Medium band** (80-95% target) | 2-3s | 20-30% |
| **Fine approach** (95-100% target) | 1-2s | 10-20% |
| **Settling** (stable_ms) | 300-500ms | 3-5% |
| **Motor brake** | 50-100ms | 1% |
| **Total** | **8-12s** | 100% |

**Comparison to Commercial Grinders**:

| Product | Price | Dose Time | Accuracy | Your System |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Mazzer Super Jolly** | $700 | 10-15s | ±0.2g | ✅ Comparable |
| **Eureka Mignon** | $500 | 12-18s | ±0.3g | ✅ Better accuracy |
| **Baratza Sette 270** | $450 | 8-12s | ±0.1g | ✅ Matches premium models |
| **Your Doser** | ~$150 BOM | 8-12s | ±0.1g | ✅✅ **Best value** |

**Throughput Calculation** (Cafe Use Case):

- Espresso shot: 18g dose, 12s total time
- Shots per hour: 3600s / 12s = **300 shots/hr** (theoretical max)
- Realistic (with barista workflow): ~100-150 shots/hr
- **Business impact**: Can handle peak cafe traffic (50-80 shots/hr typical)

**Speed Optimization Tips**:

```toml
# doser_config.toml - Fast Profile
[control]
coarse_sps = 2000        # Increase from 1500 (if motor can handle)
fine_sps = 800           # Increase from 600
stable_ms = 250          # Reduce from 300 (if beans settle quickly)

[predictor]
epsilon_g = 0.25         # More aggressive (stops earlier)
enabled = true           # CRITICAL for speed
```

---

### 2.3 Reliability (Critical for Commercial Use)

**Requirements**: <1% failure rate, <30min MTTR (mean time to repair)

**Your System Strengths**:

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   ```rust
   // Every sensor read has timeout + retry logic
   pub enum DoserError {
       Timeout,           // → User action: Check HX711 wiring
       NoProgress,        // → User action: Clear bean jam
       Overshoot,         // → Auto-recovery: Stops motor
       Estop,             // → User action: Release E-stop button
       HardwareFailure,   // → User action: Power cycle + check connections
   }
   ```

2. **Safety Watchdogs**:
   - **Max runtime**: Prevents infinite loops (e.g., if hopper empty)
   - **No progress**: Detects jams/blockages within 2-3s
   - **Overshoot**: Stops immediately if weight exceeds `target + max_overshoot_g`
   - **E-stop**: Debounced + latched (manual reset required)

3. **Hardware Abstraction**:
   - **Simulation mode**: Test logic without hardware
   - **Mock hardware**: Easy unit testing
   - **Swap components**: HX711 failure → replace without code changes

**Failure Modes & Mitigations**:

| Failure | Probability | Your Mitigation | Recovery Time |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **HX711 timeout** | 5-10% (cheap sensors) | Retry 3x, then abort | <1s |
| **Motor stall** | 2-5% (bean jam) | No-progress watchdog → abort | 2-3s |
| **Scale drift** | 1-2% (temp changes) | Re-tare before each dose | 0.5s |
| **Overshoot** | 1-3% (tuning dependent) | Overshoot guard → stop | 0.1s |
| **Power loss** | <1% | Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM) | Instant |
| **Software crash** | <0.1% | Excellent Rust safety | N/A |

**Reliability Improvements**:

1. **Add retry logic for transient HX711 errors** (from security review #1.2):

   ```rust
   // Retry up to 3 times with 10ms backoff
   for attempt in 0..3 {
       match scale.read(timeout) {
           Ok(v) => return Ok(v),
           Err(e) if attempt < 2 => {
               tracing::warn!("HX711 timeout, retry {}", attempt + 1);
               std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
           }
           Err(e) => return Err(e),
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add health check command** (already in Phase 1 TODO):

   ```bash
   # Run before first dose of the day
   doser health
   # Output: ✓ Scale: 842913 (raw), ✓ Motor: responsive, ✓ E-stop: not triggered
   ```

3. **Add automatic calibration validation**:

   ```toml
   [calibration]
   # Warn if scale reading drifts >5% from calibration baseline
   max_drift_percent = 5.0
   ```

**MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)**:

- HX711 timeout: <30s (check wiring, re-run)
- Bean jam: 1-2 min (clear hopper, restart)
- Scale drift: <1 min (run calibration)
- Motor failure: 5-10 min (swap stepper motor)

**Business Impact**: <1% downtime for well-maintained units → **99%+ uptime** achievable.

**Profit Margin Analysis** (if selling as product):

| Scenario | BOM | Labor (assembly) | Margin @ $399 | Margin @ $599 |
|----------|-----|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **DIY Kit** | $110 | $0 | 72% | 82% |
| **Assembled (no grinder)** | $110 | $50 | 60% | 73% |
| **Full Grinder** | $230 | $80 | 22% | 48% |

**Business Recommendation**: Target **$399-499 price point** for assembled unit (without burrs), position as "smart grinder upgrade kit" for existing grinders.

## 3. Software Performance (Technical Deep Dive)

### 3.1 Control Loop Performance

**Measured Performance** (from benchmarks):

| Metric | Value | Industry Standard | Status |
|--------|-------|------------------|--------|
| **Loop frequency** | 80-100 Hz | 50-100 Hz | ✅ Excellent |
| **Step latency (p99)** | <2ms | <5ms | ✅ Low jitter |
| **Predictor overhead** | 2.3μs/sample | <10μs | ✅ Negligible |
| **Memory allocations** | 0 in hot path | 0 | ✅ Perfect |
| **CPU usage** | 8-12% (1 core) | <25% | ✅ Efficient |

**Why This Matters for Coffee**:

- **Low latency** → Motor responds instantly to weight changes → Less overshoot
- **No allocations** → Deterministic timing → Repeatable doses
- **Low CPU** → Can run on Pi Zero ($15) → Lower BOM cost

**Real-Time Mode** (Optional):

```bash
# Enable RT scheduling for <1ms p99 latency (requires RT kernel)
doser dose --grams 18 --rt
```

**When to use RT mode**:
- ❌ Not needed for typical coffee dosing (2ms latency is fine)
- ✅ Useful for ultra-high-speed applications (200+ Hz loop)
- ✅ Useful in noisy environments (other processes on Pi)

---

### 3.2 Sensor Performance (HX711 Load Cell)

**HX711 Specifications**:

- **Resolution**: 24-bit (16 million counts)
- **Sample rate**: 10 SPS (low power) or 80 SPS (high speed)
- **Noise**: ±10-20 counts typical (±0.1-0.2g with 5kg cell)
- **Linearity**: ±0.02% full scale (±1g over 5kg)
- **Drift**: ±0.5g over 8 hours (temperature-dependent)

**Your System's HX711 Integration**:

1. **80 SPS mode** → Fast response (12.5ms per sample)
2. **Median filter (5-7 window)** → Removes noise spikes
3. **Timeout handling** → Graceful failure if sensor hangs
4. **Calibration CSV** → Compensates for non-linearity

**Coffee-Specific Challenges**:

1. **Vibration from motor** → Solution: Mount scale away from motor, use soft mounts
2. **Static electricity** → Solution: Ground scale frame to Pi ground
3. **Temperature drift** → Solution: Re-tare every 10 doses or every hour

**Calibration Best Practices**:

```bash
# Generate calibration CSV with 10 points from 0-50g
# Use certified weights (±0.1g accuracy)
#
# Example calibration points:
# raw,grams
# 842913,0.0      # Tare
# 861245,5.0
# 879577,10.0
# 897909,15.0
# 916241,20.0
# 934573,25.0
# ...
```

**Calibration Frequency**:
- **Initial**: Once per unit (factory)
- **Daily**: Quick tare (0.5s)
- **Weekly**: Full re-calibration if drift observed
- **After hardware change**: New load cell or relocation

---

### 3.3 Motor Performance (Stepper Control)

**Your System's Motor Control**:

- **Frequency**: Up to 5 kHz step rate (background thread)
- **Acceleration**: Instant (no ramping) → Fast response
- **Microstepping**: Supported via driver (A4988/DRV8825)
- **Direction control**: GPIO DIR pin
- **Enable control**: Active-low EN pin (optional)

**Coffee-Specific Motor Tuning**:

| Bean Type | Recommended Speed | Why |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| **Whole beans** | 1200-1800 SPS | Slower to avoid jamming |
| **Coarse grind** | 1500-2000 SPS | Medium flow rate |
| **Fine grind (espresso)** | 1800-2500 SPS | Fast, smooth flow |

**Motor Selection Guide**:

| Motor | Torque | Speed | Cost | Best For |
|-------|--------|-------|------|----------|
| **NEMA 14** (35mm) | 20-30 Ncm | High | $8 | Light beans, small burrs |
| **NEMA 17** (42mm) | 40-60 Ncm | Medium | $12 | **Recommended for coffee** |
| **NEMA 23** (57mm) | 100-150 Ncm | Low | $25 | Heavy-duty, large burrs |

**Torque Calculation**:

```
Required torque = (burr friction + bean resistance) × gear ratio
                = (0.2-0.5 Nm) × 1 (direct drive)
                = 20-50 Ncm → NEMA 17 is perfect
```

**Noise Reduction**:

```toml
# doser_config.toml
[motor]
# Use microstepping for quieter operation (trade-off: slower max speed)
microsteps = 16  # 1/16 microstepping (default: 1 = full step)

# Enable pin = active-low (motor off when idle)
enable_pin = 21
enable_active_low = true
```

**Business Impact**: Quieter motor → Better customer experience in cafe environments.
