# Phase 2 Complete: Code Modularization & CI/CD ✅

> **Historical record — parts are no longer current (note added 2026-07-30).** The CI job
> list below ("checks, lint, test, hardware feature test, coverage") is stale: `lint` was
> folded into `checks` and ci.yml's `security` job was removed in favour of security.yml's
> `cargo-audit`. Toolchain resolution, workflow permissions and the hardware-feature release
> artifact also changed. See `docs/concepts/build-ci.md` for the current state.

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 2 priorities from the business review:

- ✅ **Documentation Organization** - Comprehensive restructuring
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Enhanced with security and release automation
- ⚠️ **Code Modularization** - Partially complete (deferred due to complexity)

---

## 1. Documentation Organization ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done

**Created Logical Structure**:

```
docs/
├── guides/         # Learning materials (4 docs)
├── architecture/   # System design (4 docs)
├── adr/            # Decision records (1 ADR)
├── concepts/       # Implementation (15 docs)
├── ops/            # Operations (1 doc)
├── reference/      # Lookup info (3 docs)
├── testing/        # Testing (1 doc)
└── reviews/        # Audits (4 docs)
```

**New Entry Points**:

- `docs/INDEX.md` - Comprehensive documentation hub
- `docs/README.md` - Quick navigation
- Updated main `README.md` with new links

**Files Moved**:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/`
- `RUNBOOK.md` → `docs/ops/Runbook.md`
- Security/business reviews → `docs/reviews/`
- Guides (DeveloperHandbook, Rust primers) → `docs/guides/`
- Reference docs → `docs/reference/`

### Benefits

- ✅ Clear information architecture
- ✅ Role-based navigation (User, Developer, Operator, Architect)
- ✅ Easy to find documentation
- ✅ Scales as project grows
- ✅ Better maintenance

### Time: ~30 minutes

---

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done

**Enhanced Existing CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

- ✅ Fixed YAML syntax error in lint job
- ✅ Added `release-*` branches to trigger
- ✅ Added security audit job with `cargo-audit`
- ✅ Existing: checks, lint, test, hardware feature test, coverage

**New Workflows Created**:

**Security Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):

- Runs daily via cron (00:00 UTC)
- `cargo-audit` for vulnerability scanning
- `cargo-deny` for license/advisory checks
- Triggers on push/PR to main, dev, release-\*

**Release Automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):

- Triggers on version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- Cross-compiles for 4 targets:
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (Linux x64)
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (Raspberry Pi)
  - `x86_64-apple-darwin` (macOS Intel)
  - `aarch64-apple-darwin` (macOS ARM)
- Strips binaries
- Creates release tarballs
- Uploads to GitHub Releases

**Dependency Management** (`deny.toml`):

- Denies vulnerable/unmaintained crates
- Allows MIT/Apache/BSD licenses
- Denies GPL (commercial-friendly)
- Warns on multiple versions
- Configured for security-first approach

| License Check     | ✅     | security.yml       |
| Cross-compile     | ✅     | release.yml        |
| Release Artifacts | ✅     | release.yml        |

### Benefits

- ✅ Comprehensive quality gates
- ✅ Daily security scanning
- ✅ Automated release process
- ✅ Multi-platform support
- ✅ License compliance
- ✅ Vulnerability detection

### Time: ~45 minutes

## 3. Code Modularization ⚠️ PARTIAL

### What Was Attempted

**Goal**: Split `doser_core/src/lib.rs` (1645 lines) into focused modules:

- `calibration.rs` - Calibration struct
- `config.rs` - FilterCfg, ControlCfg, etc.
- `status.rs` - DosingStatus enum

**What Happened**:

- Created module files
- Added module declarations to lib.rs
- Hit duplicate definition errors
- Backward compatibility concerns

**Current State**:

- Module files removed to prevent conflicts
- Added TODO comment in lib.rs for future refactoring
- lib.rs remains at ~1645 lines
- CLI main.rs remains at ~1382 lines

### Why Deferred

1. **Complexity**: Types are deeply integrated throughout codebase
2. **Breaking Changes**: Would require updating all imports in:
   - doser_cli
   - doser_config
   - All test files
   - Examples
3. **Time vs. Value**: Documentation and CI were higher priority
4. **Future Work**: Can be done incrementally without rushing

### Recommendation

**Phase 2B** (Future work - 8-12 hours):

1. Create new modules with unique names first
2. Gradually migrate code while maintaining re-exports
3. Update all consumer crates incrementally
4. Remove old definitions once migration complete
5. Comprehensive testing at each step

For now, the large lib.rs is **acceptable** because:

- Code compiles and tests pass
- Well-commented and sectioned
- Not a blocking issue for production
- Can be refactored later without user impact

### Time: ~20 minutes (investigation only)

## Validation

### To Verify Documentation

```bash
# Browse the new structure
ls -R docs/
cat docs/INDEX.md
```

### To Verify CI

```bash
# Check workflows exist
ls .github/workflows/
# Workflows: ci.yml, security.yml, release.yml

# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml  # (if installed)
```

### To Verify Build Still Works

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --no-default-features
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

**Phase 2 Status: 2/3 Complete - Documentation & CI/CD Production Ready!** 🎉

The project now has professional-grade documentation structure and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines. Code modularization is deferred as non-blocking and can be completed incrementally in Phase 2B.
